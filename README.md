 - **[Open-RS]:** Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn't. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16219), [Code](https://github.com/knoveleng/open-rs)<br>
    TLDR: Small language models can efficiently improve their reasoning skills through reinforcement learning using minimal data and computational resources, with training stabilized by a mix of easy and hard problems and output length managed by cosine rewards, though complex tasks may require longer context limits.<br>
