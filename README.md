# AdvancedReasoningLM
A curated collection of research papers on complex reasoning with language models.

## Benchmark

## Methodology
 - **[Tina]:** Tina: Tiny Reasoning Models via LoRA. [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15777), [Code](https://github.com/shangshang-wang/Tina)<br>
    <span style="color:#FFC0CB;">**TLDR:**</span> <br>
    <span style="color:#90EE90;">**Keywords:**</span> `2025` `arXiv` `LoRA` `Reinforcement Learning` `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B` `Mathematical Reasoning` `Scientific Reasoning` `GRPO`

## Analysis
 - **[Open-RS]:** Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn't. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16219), [Code](https://github.com/knoveleng/open-rs)<br>
    <span style="color:#90EE90;">**TLDR:**</span> Small language models can efficiently improve their reasoning skills through reinforcement learning using minimal data and computational resources, with training stabilized by a mix of easy and hard problems and output length managed by cosine rewards, though complex tasks may require longer context limits.<br>
